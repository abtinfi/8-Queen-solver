### **Install `tkinter` (if not already installed)**:
- **Ubuntu/Debian**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3-tk
  ```
- **Fedora**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
  ```
- **Windows/macOS**:  
  `tkinter` is usually pre-installed. If you get an error, ensure Python is installed correctly.
